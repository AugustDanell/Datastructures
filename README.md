# Datastructures
This is a repository where I implement various datastructures as a way of improving both my conceptual understanding of them while at the same time improving upon my Python skills. I think datastructures are very interesting and for me personally I was quite interesting in them specifically after having implemented BFS and DFS searches on graphs. I realized that it was quite hard when I was new at programming, however, in writing a generalized traversal algorithm I could then provide the algorithm with a stack or a queue to do DFS or BFS respectively, and the code made much more sense in an intuitive way. As such the concept of datastructures is very interesting to me in how they can be of use to facilitate.

In this repo I implement among other datastructures the very common ones, Linked Lists, single and double linked, binary search trees, graphs, stacks, queues .. and more datastructures will come, no doubt! :) 

// All the best
